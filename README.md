Algorithm that finds solutions to the next problem:

There are 4 pentagons, one inside the other. Place the odd numbers from 1 to 31, both inclusive, and the numbers 20, 32, 34, 38 and 40 in the 20 vertices of the 4 pentagons, and one number in the center, so that the sum of the 5 numbers of the vertices of any pentagon equals the sum of the five numbers of any radius and equals 100.
